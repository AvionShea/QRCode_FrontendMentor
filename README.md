## Overview

Created a solution to the QR Code challenge from FontendMentor.io. At the time of this project, I am participating in the #100Devs Bootcamp created by Leon Noel. I started the bootcamp on 1/13/2023 and have since watched the first 6 videos. In between videos, I like to practice with different projects, so I can solidify what I learned as well as practice stuff I will learn in the future.

## My process

Looking at the image provided, I divided the picture into several areas. During this phase, I determine which HTML elements would be the most useful for a project. Sections, an image, paragraphs, and footer element(tags) were the HTML elements that I felt would be the most beneficial. From there, I selected the HTML file and renamed or created the elements that would be needed to create the QR Code project. Afterwards, I created the CSS file and linked, both, the CSS and fonts that I would be using to the HTML file. Once that was done, I saved the file and opened it in my default browser. During the coding process, I save my files and refresh my browser to ensure everything is working properly. For me, doing this constantly allows for me to troubleshoot a problem sooner rather than later.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Some things I learned while completing this project are:

- Position (Relative)
- Images (as backgrounds)

The code I'm particularly proud of:
```css
  .code {
      background-image: url(images/image-qr-code.png);
      position: relative;
      left: 25px;
      top: 20px;
      width: 400px;
      height: 400px;
      border-radius: 30px;
  }
```

This code allows the QR code to move with the background portion of this project. I am not 100% comfortable with positions and the nature of how they work, but I was able to figure it out for this project using trial and error. In addition, I was able to learn a little about using an image as a background, and using CSS to edit how it looks and function.

### Continued development

Things I will continue to focus on:
- CSS positions
- CSS flexbox
- Git
- GitHub

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Helped with CSS questions I had while completing this. Give explanations and examples. Great resource for all.
